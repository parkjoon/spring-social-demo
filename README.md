# spring-social-demo
Example implementation of the Spring Social and Spring Boot projects with OAuth2.0.
Integration with Google and Facebook.

Much of the code was borrowed from Official Spring examples and Petri Kainulainen's blog. I take no credit for the application, as I have only implemented it to work in certain ways pertaining to my needs.
